The use of the Book of the Dead declined for several reasons:

1. **Changing Religious Beliefs**: Over time, the religious beliefs and practices in Egypt evolved. The rise of Christianity in Egypt during the Roman period led to a decline in the use of traditional Egyptian funerary texts¹.

2. **Economic Factors**: The production of the Book of the Dead was expensive. As economic conditions changed, fewer people could afford the elaborate scrolls².

3. **Simplification of Funerary Practices**: Later periods saw a simplification of funerary practices. Instead of lengthy texts, shorter and more accessible prayers and spells became more common⁴.

4. **Political Changes**: The conquest of Egypt by foreign powers, such as the Greeks and Romans, brought new cultural and religious influences that overshadowed traditional Egyptian practices².

These factors collectively contributed to the decline in the use of the Book of the Dead.
