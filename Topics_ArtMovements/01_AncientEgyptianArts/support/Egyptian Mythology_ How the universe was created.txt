Egyptian Mythology: How the universe was created

Egyptian mythology offers several versions of cosmogony, each associated with a different city or religious center. However, there are recurring themes and motifs throughout these narratives.

One of the most well-known versions originates from Heliopolis, while others are rooted in cities such as Hermopolis, Memphis, and Thebes.



Below is an overview of the Heliopolitan cosmogony (Ennead of Heliopolis):

Nun and the Primordial Waters of Nothingness

Before the world existed, there was Nun, the chaotic waters of the void, an infinite expanse of darkness and primordial waters.

Emergence of the Benben and Atum

From these waters, a mound or hill, known as the Benben, emerged. Atop this hill, the first deity, Atum (sometimes associated with Ra, the sun god), came into being.

It is said that Atum, a sun deity, existed in a dormant or asleep state for an immeasurable span of time. This portrayal emphasizes the idea of a world before creation — a state of nothingness, stillness, and potential.

Atum creates the first Egyptian deities

Atum was a self-created deity. He created the first pair of deities, Shu (the god of air) and Tefnut (the goddess of moisture), through a process described in some texts as autogenesis (self-generation, sometimes symbolically described as spitting, sneezing, or through more intimate means).

	How Atum actually created Shu and Tefnut
In Egyptian mythology, the act of creation is often illustrated using human analogies to help convey abstract concepts. For the creation of the first deities, the myth employs the metaphor of masturbation for Atum’s self-generative act. The hand Atum used symbolizes the feminine aspect present within him.

Additionally, the myth describes Atum as having “sneezed” and “spat” to bring forth the deities Shu and Tefnut. This description is rooted in wordplay, as the Egyptian words for these actions sound similar to the names of the deities. Through these metaphors and puns, the story conveys the idea of spontaneous creation and the interconnectedness of the divine entities.

The Birth of the Sky and the Earth
Shu and Tefnut went on to produce two offspring: Nut (the sky goddess) and Geb (the earth god). The depiction of Nut arched over Geb, with Shu standing between them, separating the sky from the earth, is a common visual representation in ancient Egyptian art.

Birth of Osiris, Isis, Seth, and Nephthys
Nut and Geb birthed four children – Osiris, Egyptian god of fertility and the afterlife; Isis, goddess of motherhood and magic; Seth, god of chaos and storms; and Nephthys, goddess of protection.

These four gods play pivotal roles in various Egyptian myths, particularly the story of Osiris’s murder by his brother Seth and his resurrection with the aid of his wife, Isis.

	Reason why Atum created the first deities

Per the Heliopolitan cosmogony, the eight deities that came after Atum were seen as the extensions of the creator god. Together with these gods, Atum was able to hold back the destructive forces of chaos and keep the universe in balance. The purpose of creating those deities was aimed at keeping Ma’at (i.e. personification of order and truth) alive.

	Ancient Egyptians’ explanation for the complex nature of the world

With each subsequent generation of deities, the complexity and diversity of the world increased, encapsulating all facets of nature. Each feature, from the mightiest river to the tiniest insect, was given a divine overseer, highlighting the interconnectedness of nature and divinity in ancient Egyptian belief.

The pantheon’s gradual expansion represents the organized unfolding of the cosmos from a singular origin to the intricate, multifaceted world the Egyptians knew.

How Egyptian temples as models of the universe

Egyptian temples were architectural representations of the universe’s inception, with their innermost sections symbolizing the primordial hill.

As worshipers progressed from the temple’s exterior to its interior, they experienced rising floor levels and decreasing ceiling heights, transitioning from well-lit areas to dimly lit inner sanctums.

This dim ambiance recreated the ancient world’s atmosphere, a time when the world was devoid of form and meaning.

Egyptologists state that only a select few, mainly priests and the Pharaoh, had the privilege to enter the temple’s most sacred space.

Within this framework, the hypostyle hall, characterized by its multitude of columns that support a grand roof, was designed to resemble a dense cluster of papyrus reeds reminiscent of the marshes surrounding Benben, the first mound of creation.

Variations in the creation story
While the Heliopolitan cosmogony is central in Egyptian mythology, other cities and regions had their own versions of creation. Simply put, ancient Egypt had a number of creator deities and their corresponding creation stories.

For example, in the Hermopolitan cosmogony, the world began with the Ogdoad, a group of eight primordial deities, who represented the chaos that existed before creation. Over time, these various cosmogonies coexisted and intertwined, reflecting the rich tapestry of ancient Egyptian religious beliefs and practices.

The Pyramid Texts

In ancient Egypt, understanding the cosmos and the origin of life was essential to their religious beliefs and practices. The Pyramid Texts are among the earliest comprehensive religious compositions from ancient Egypt.

Dating from the Old Kingdom, specifically the era spanning c. 2700–2200 BC, these texts were inscribed on the walls of the interior chambers of pyramids. They were essentially funerary inscriptions, guiding the deceased pharaohs through the afterlife, ensuring their immortality, and linking them with the gods.

In addition to describing the afterlife and ensuring the pharaoh’s safe passage, the Pyramid Texts and other tomb inscriptions also elucidated the interconnectedness of creation myths with the reigning monarch, reinforcing the divine right and role of the pharaoh as the living god on earth, a direct descendant of the deities who created the world.
