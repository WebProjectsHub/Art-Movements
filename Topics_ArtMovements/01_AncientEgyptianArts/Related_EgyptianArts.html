				<h2>
					Djed
				</h2>
				<p>
The Djed is an ancient Egyptian symbol for stability which features prominently in Egyptian art and architecture throughout the country's history. `Stability' should be understood to mean not only a firm footing but immutability and permanance. The symbol is a column with a broad base which narrows as it rises to a capital and is crossed by four parallel lines. The column and the lines are sometimes brightly painted and other times monochrome. The djed first appears in the Predynastic Period in Egypt (c. 6000-3150 BCE) and continues through the Ptolemaic Dynasty (323-30 BCE), the last dynasty to rule Egypt before it became a province of the Roman Empire.

				<h2>
					Unification of Upper and Lower Egypt by King Narmer
				</h2>
				<p>
The Two Lands (Upper and Lower Egypt) became united around 3000 BC under a single king, Narmer (or Menes), who ruled as the first king of Upper and Lower Egypt. Already in this early period, many of the distinct characteristics of Egyptian culture, including kingship ideology, writing system, social structure, religious beliefs, and modes of artistic representation were introduced and codified.

				<h2>
					Imhotep
				</h2>
				<p>
Imhotep (born 27th or 26th century BC) was a vizier, sage, architect, astrologer, and chief minister to Djoser (reigned c. 2592–c. 2566 BC), the first king of Egypt’s Third Dynasty.  He was later worshipped as the god of medicine in Egypt and in Greece, where he was identified with the Greek god of medicine, Asclepius. He is considered to be the architect of the step pyramid built at the necropolis of Ṣaqqārah in Memphis. It is the oldest extant monument of hewn stone known to the world.
		<br><br>
Imhotep’s high standing in Djoser’s court is affirmed by an inscription bearing his name on a statue of Djoser found at the site of the Ṣaqqārah pyramid. The inscription lists a variety of titles, including chief of the sculptors and chief of the seers. Although no contemporary account has been found that refers to Imhotep as a practicing physician, documents on Egyptian society and medicine during the Old Kingdom (c. 2543–c. 2120 BC) show that the chief magician of the pharaoh’s court also frequently served as the nation’s chief physician. Imhotep’s reputation as the reigning genius of the time, his position in the court, his training as a scribe, and his becoming known as a medical demigod only 100 years after his death are strong indications that he must have been a physician of considerable skill.

				<h2>
					Shabti Dolls
				</h2>
				<p>
The shabti dolls of Ancient Egypt are a fascinating aspect of their funerary practices, reflecting the Egyptians' beliefs about the afterlife and the continuation of one's duties beyond death. These small figurines, often inscribed with a spell known as the shabti formula, were intended to act as servants for the deceased in the afterlife, performing any labor that was asked of them. This practice was rooted in the Egyptian concept of the afterlife as a reflection of earthly life, where the soul, having successfully navigated the trials of the underworld, would reside in the idyllic Field of Reeds. Here, amidst the familiar comforts of home and community, the shabti dolls ensured that the deceased could enjoy eternal rest without the burdens of daily toil. The integration of such practices highlights the ancient Egyptians' deep connection to their community and their meticulous attention to the spiritual journey that awaited them after death.

				<h2>
					Color in Ancient Egypt
				</h2>
				<p>
Modern cultures consider many of the materials used by the ancient Egyptians to be semi-precious (like turquoise) or cheap (like glass). To the Egyptians it was not just the value or scarcity of the materials that mattered (although of course gold and silver were particularly highly prized), but the symbolic meaning of the colours and the beauty of the image that they could construct from them. Colors were not used randomly, but were intended to convey meaning and imbue an image with greater power.
		<br><br>
The word “iwn” (color) also translates as “disposition”, “character”, “complexion” and “nature”, confirming that color was seen as being intimately linked to the essence of being.
		<br><br>
The ancient Egyptian palette was formed around six main color groups: green (wadj); red (desher); blue (irtyu or khesbedj); yellow (khenet or kenit); white (hedj or shesep); and black (kem).
		<br><br>
The ancient Egyptians used mineral compounds to add color to their art. As a result, some of the colors are still vibrant and beautiful thousands of years later. They made jewellery out of amethyst, garnet, jasper, onyx, hematite, turquoise, lapis lazuli, copper, malachite (a form of copper ore), gold, silver, faience and shells.

				<h2>
					Tombs in Ancient Egypt
				</h2>
				<p>
The most elaborate tombs in ancient times were those built by the Egyptians for their kings, the pharaohs. In the Early Dynastic Period (c. 3150-c. 2613 BC), the Egyptians built mastabas, tombs made of dried clay bricks which were then used to shore up shafts and chambers dug into the earth. In every mastaba there was a large room for ceremonies honoring the spirit of the deceased and an adjoining smaller room, the serdab, where a statue of the dead person would be placed so that the spirit could witness and enjoy the ceremonies. The mastaba - the oldest form of the tomb in Egypt - continued in use for the common people but for royalty it was replaced by the structure known as the pyramid during the Old Kingdom (c. 2613-2181 BC).
		<br><br>
Commencing with the Step Pyramid at Saqqara, the royal pyramids would reach their height in splendor in the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza (built for King Khufu, r. 2589-2566 BC). The royal pyramids were adorned with paintings depicting the life and accomplishments of the deceased king and filled with all those necessities the spirit would need in the afterlife in the Field of Reeds, the Egyptian paradise. Monarchs were also interred in the area known as The Valley of the Kings and their tombs were elaborate eternal homes, highly ornamented, which reflected their status as divine rulers.

			<h2>
				Stela
			</h2>
			<p>
A stela is an upright monument containing information in the form of texts, images or a combination of the two. Stelae have been used to commemorate people or events, to delineate physical spaces or as objects through which to access the dead or divine. Such monuments were made by a variety of cultures in the ancient world.  
		<br><br>
Egyptian stelae originated during the first dynasty as burial markers in the necropolis at Abydos, in the form of round-topped stone pillars inscribed with the king’s name and stone slabs with the names and titles of his officials.

			<h2>
				Ma'at
			</h2>
			<p>
Ma'at (pronounced may-et) is the ancient Egyptian goddess of truth, justice, harmony, and balance (a concept known as ma'at in Egyptian) who first appears during the period known as the Old Kingdom (c. 2613 - 2181 BC) but no doubt existed in some form earlier. She is depicted in anthropomorphic form as a winged woman, often in profile with an ostrich feather on her head, or simply as a white ostrich feather. The feather of Ma'at was an integral part of the Weighing of the Heart of the Soul ceremony in the afterlife where the heart of the soul of the dead person was weighed in the scales of justice against the feather.

			<h2>
				Temples in Ancient Egypt
			</h2>
			<p>
In the religious customs of ancient Egypt the temple was considered 'the horizon' of a divine being, the point at which the god came into existence at creation, and thus every sacred site had a link to the very distant past and honored the specific god whose temple it was. The temple also was a mirror of the universe and a representation of the ben-ben, the sacred mound which rose out of chaos by the will of Amon at the beginning of time. At the same time, the temple was a site set aside for communion with the gods, as at the famous temple of Karnak.

			<h2>
				Orientalizing Period
			</h2>
			<p>
The Orientalizing Period in Greece refers to a roughly 100-year period in which Greek art was greatly influenced by eastern, and specifically Near Eastern and Egyptian, ideas, myths, and decorative styles. 
		<br><br>
The Orientalizing Period lasted from about the mid-8th until the mid-7th centuries B.C.

			<h2>
				Egyptomania
			</h2>
			<p>
Egyptomania: the madness for things related to ancient Egyptian culture.
		<br><br>
The Ancient Romans became captivated by Egyptian art after Emperor Augustus conquered the lands in North Africa in 31 BC.
		<br><br>
Europeans developed “Egyptomania” after Napoleon Bonaparte’s 1798 campaign in Egypt, which included the modern discovery of the famed Rosetta Stone. 
		<br><br>
When British archaeologists uncovered the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun in 1922, public curiosity about Egyptian culture took off with “Tut-mania.”
		<br><br>
Though fashions shifted in and out, American and European designers would return to reference Egyptian ornament for much of the nineteenth-century.
		<br><br>
The popularity for Egyptian ornament remained through the century, finally becoming an integral part of the 1920s–30s <a href="../../Topics_Timeline/Timeline.html#section20">Art Deco</a> style.

			<h2>
				Great Sphinx
			</h2>
			<p>
The Great Sphinx of Giza is a giant 4,500-year-old limestone statue situated near the Great Pyramid in Giza, Egypt. Measuring 73 meters long and 20 meters high, the Great Sphinx is one of the world’s largest monuments. It is also one of the most recognizable relics of the ancient Egyptians, though the origins and history of the colossal structure are still debated.
		<br><br>
A sphinx (or sphynx) is a creature with the body of a lion and the head of a human, with some variations. It is a prominent mythological figure in Egyptian, Asian, and Greek mythology.
		<br><br>
In ancient Egypt, the sphinx was a spiritual guardian and most often depicted as a male with a pharaoh headdress—as is the Great Sphinx—and figures of the creatures were often included in tomb and temple complexes. For instance, the so-called Sphinx Alley in Upper Egypt is a two-mile avenue that connects the temples of Luxor and Karnak and is lined with sphinx statues.
		<br><br>
Sphinxes with the likeness of the female pharaoh Hatshepsut also exist, such as the granite sphinx statue at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the large alabaster sphinx at the Ramessid temple in Memphis, Egypt.
