				<h2>
					Djed
				</h2>
				<p>
The Djed is an ancient Egyptian symbol for stability which features prominently in Egyptian art and architecture throughout the country's history. `Stability' should be understood to mean not only a firm footing but immutability and permanance. The symbol is a column with a broad base which narrows as it rises to a capital and is crossed by four parallel lines. The column and the lines are sometimes brightly painted and other times monochrome. The djed first appears in the Predynastic Period in Egypt (c. 6000-3150 BCE) and continues through the Ptolemaic Dynasty (323-30 BCE), the last dynasty to rule Egypt before it became a province of the Roman Empire.

				<h2>
					Unification of Upper and Lower Egypt by King Narmer
				</h2>
				<p>
The Two Lands (Upper and Lower Egypt) became united around 3000 BC under a single king, Narmer (or Menes), who ruled as the first king of Upper and Lower Egypt. Already in this early period, many of the distinct characteristics of Egyptian culture, including kingship ideology, writing system, social structure, religious beliefs, and modes of artistic representation were introduced and codified.

				<h2>
					Imhotep
				</h2>
				<p>
Imhotep (born 27th or 26th century BC) was a vizier, sage, architect, astrologer, and chief minister to Djoser (reigned c. 2592–c. 2566 BC), the first king of Egypt’s Third Dynasty.  He was later worshipped as the god of medicine in Egypt and in Greece, where he was identified with the Greek god of medicine, Asclepius. He is considered to be the architect of the step pyramid built at the necropolis of Ṣaqqārah in Memphis. It is the oldest extant monument of hewn stone known to the world.
		<br><br>
Imhotep’s high standing in Djoser’s court is affirmed by an inscription bearing his name on a statue of Djoser found at the site of the Ṣaqqārah pyramid. The inscription lists a variety of titles, including chief of the sculptors and chief of the seers. Although no contemporary account has been found that refers to Imhotep as a practicing physician, documents on Egyptian society and medicine during the Old Kingdom (c. 2543–c. 2120 BC) show that the chief magician of the pharaoh’s court also frequently served as the nation’s chief physician. Imhotep’s reputation as the reigning genius of the time, his position in the court, his training as a scribe, and his becoming known as a medical demigod only 100 years after his death are strong indications that he must have been a physician of considerable skill.

				<h2>
					Shabti Dolls
				</h2>
				<p>
The shabti dolls of Ancient Egypt are a fascinating aspect of their funerary practices, reflecting the Egyptians' beliefs about the afterlife and the continuation of one's duties beyond death. These small figurines, often inscribed with a spell known as the shabti formula, were intended to act as servants for the deceased in the afterlife, performing any labor that was asked of them. This practice was rooted in the Egyptian concept of the afterlife as a reflection of earthly life, where the soul, having successfully navigated the trials of the underworld, would reside in the idyllic Field of Reeds. Here, amidst the familiar comforts of home and community, the shabti dolls ensured that the deceased could enjoy eternal rest without the burdens of daily toil. The integration of such practices highlights the ancient Egyptians' deep connection to their community and their meticulous attention to the spiritual journey that awaited them after death.

				<h2>
					Color in Ancient Egypt
				</h2>
				<p>
Modern cultures consider many of the materials used by the ancient Egyptians to be semi-precious (like turquoise) or cheap (like glass). To the Egyptians it was not just the value or scarcity of the materials that mattered (although of course gold and silver were particularly highly prized), but the symbolic meaning of the colours and the beauty of the image that they could construct from them. Colors were not used randomly, but were intended to convey meaning and imbue an image with greater power.
		<br><br>
The word “iwn” (color) also translates as “disposition”, “character”, “complexion” and “nature”, confirming that color was seen as being intimately linked to the essence of being.
		<br><br>
The ancient Egyptian palette was formed around six main color groups: green (wadj); red (desher); blue (irtyu or khesbedj); yellow (khenet or kenit); white (hedj or shesep); and black (kem).
		<br><br>
The ancient Egyptians used mineral compounds to add color to their art. As a result, some of the colors are still vibrant and beautiful thousands of years later. They made jewellery out of amethyst, garnet, jasper, onyx, hematite, turquoise, lapis lazuli, copper, malachite (a form of copper ore), gold, silver, faience and shells.
