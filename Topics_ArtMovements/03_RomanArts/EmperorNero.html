		<h4>
Introduction
		</h4>
		<p>
Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (15 December 37 AD – 9 June 68 AD) was the last Roman Emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. His great-uncle Claudius adopted him, making Nero his successor. Nero was proclaimed Emperor with the consent of the Praetorian Guard. His mother, Agrippina the Younger, was likely implicated in Claudius's death to ensure Nero's ascension. However, despite her early influence over him, Nero murdered her five years into his reign.
	<br><br>
In the early years of his reign, Nero's decisions and achievements were heavily influenced by his mother, his tutor Lucius Annaeus Seneca, and his Praetorian prefect, Sextus Afranius Burrus. As he matured, Nero began to assert his independence, taking a more active role in government and foreign policy. 
	<br><br>
Nero became known for his diplomatic skills and his efforts to develop the cultural life of the empire. He commissioned the construction of theaters and promoted athletic games. His hobby was making public appearances as a poet, actor, and musician. Unfortunately, his extensive public and private works program led to higher taxes. Additionally, Nero executed many individuals, including numerous conspirators who sought to assassinate him due to his extravagant rule.
	<br><br>

		<h4>
Early Life of Emperor Nero
		</h4>
		<p>
Nero was born Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus on 15 December 37 AD. After his mother, Agrippina the Younger, married Emperor Claudius in 49 AD, Nero was adopted by Claudius in 50 AD and renamed Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus. Nero's father, a violent man, died when Nero was just three years old. Agrippina the Younger was the daughter of Agrippina the Elder and the great-granddaughter of Emperor Augustus.
	<br><br>
One of the most infamous emperors, Caligula, reigned from 37 AD until 41 AD and was assassinated by his own Praetorian Guard. Claudius succeeded Caligula, and Agrippina persuaded him to adopt Nero, planning to make Nero the next emperor and influence his decisions.
	<br><br>
Nero officially entered public life around 51 AD at the age of 14. At 16, he married Claudia Octavia, Claudius's daughter. During this period, Nero gave speeches about various communities, including the Ilians and Arameans, requesting a five-year tax delay after an earthquake, and addressing the northern colony of Bologna, which suffered a destructive fire.
	<br><br>
Claudius died in 54 AD, reportedly poisoned by Agrippina. Before realizing her plan, she replaced the guard officers with loyal men, ensuring Nero became the new ruler without incident.
	<br><br>
		</p>
		<h4>
Reign
		</h4>
		<p>
According to historians such as Tacitus, Suetonius, and Cassius Dio, Nero’s building projects were extravagant and costly. He became emperor at the age of 16, making him the youngest sole emperor until Elagabalus, who ascended the throne at 14 in 218 AD. The future Emperor Trajan described Nero’s reign as Quinquennium Neronis, but the phrase’s interpretation remains ambiguous. When Nero was proclaimed Pharaoh of Egypt, he adopted the titulary Autokrator Neron Heqaheqau Meryasetptah Tjemaahuikhasut Wernakhtubaqet Heqaheqau Setepennemu Merur, which translates to Emperor Nero, Ruler of rulers, chosen by Ptah, beloved of Isis, the sturdy-armed one who struck the foreign lands, victorious for Egypt, ruler of rulers, chosen of Nun who loves him.
	<br><br>
At the beginning of his reign, Nero promised to follow the Augustan model, abolish the treasury trials of Tiberius, end corruption, and respect the privileges of the Senate and individual Senators. Agrippina aimed to rule through her son and eliminated political rivals. One of the first coins issued by Nero depicted Agrippina. The populace initially welcomed the new emperor, considering the first part of his reign a mini-golden age. Furthermore, Nero restored much of the Senate’s lost power.
	<br><br>
Nero organized lavish games, plays, concerts, and gladiator battles, and reduced taxes, leading the populace to view him as generous and intelligent.
	<br><br>
		</p>
		<h4>
Relationship with Agrippina
		</h4>
		<p>
Agrippina was an overly protective mother who sought to be the true force behind her son, Nero. She even managed to extend her influence to others. However, Nero disliked his mother's overbearing nature and moved her out of the palace. Later, he denied her the protection of her Praetorian Guard and banned Agrippina from all gladiatorial contests. When Agrippina realized she was losing her power, she started to fight back by throwing her support behind Britannicus, Nero’s stepbrother and the son of Claudius. However, Britannicus mysteriously died at a family banquet due to food poisoning, making Agrippina realize she was next.
	<br><br>
Nero planned his mother's death with the help of specialists from Alexandria. First, he devised a plan to create a device for the bedchamber ceiling that would collapse and crush her while she slept. However, the structure was too complicated. His second plan was to build a boat that would collapse and sink, but Agrippina managed to swim to shore. Finally, Nero resorted to stabbing his mother to death, a deed that haunted him for the rest of his life.
	<br><br>
		</p>
		<h4>
Personal Life
		</h4>
		<p>
Nero was married to Octavia, the daughter of Claudius and Messalina, but he had an affair with Poppaea Sabina. Agrippina, who detested Poppaea, forced Nero to marry Octavia. To marry the woman he loved, Nero accused Octavia of adultery and exiled her. Subsequently, Octavia was murdered, but Nero made it appear as a suicide. However, Nero’s second marriage was not a happy one. Poppaea and Nero's child died shortly after birth, and Poppaea’s next pregnancy ended in tragedy. During an argument, Nero kicked her in the stomach, resulting in the death of both Poppaea and their unborn child.
	<br><br>
		</p>
		<h4>
Great Fire of Rome and Other Disasters
		</h4>
		<p>
Nero's reign was marked by numerous catastrophes. Among them was the Piso Conspiracy, an assassination plot involving at least nineteen senators and other leaders. The failure of this plan led to the execution of forty-one people and left Nero perpetually paranoid and distrustful. Additionally, Nero faced the failed **Boudicca Rebellion** in Britain, and there were many insurrections in nearby provinces, including Gaul and Judea.

The most significant event and threat to Nero's reign was the <a href="./TheGreatFireOfRome.html">Great Fire of Rome</a>, which began on July 19, 64 AD, and lasted for six days. The fire devastated ten of Rome's fourteen districts, resulting in hundreds of deaths and leaving thousands homeless. Many questions remain about this fire, including whether Nero played his lyre as the city burned or if he started the fire himself. Historians are divided: some believe Nero started the fire and watched it from the Tower of Maecenas, while others blame the persecuted Christians, who viewed Nero as the anti-Christ.

To rebuild Rome, Nero raised taxes. After reconstruction, the city was transformed with wider streets, new brick buildings, and beautiful colonnades.

Suicide
		</h4>
		<p>
Nero's life was fraught with insurrections, conspiracies, and other negative events. He was eventually proclaimed an enemy of the public by the Senate. As a result, Galba became the new emperor. Realizing that he was no longer emperor, Nero attempted suicide in the villa of his freedman, Phaon. However, he failed to do it alone and needed assistance to end his life. His last words were, <i>"What an artist dies in me."</i>
