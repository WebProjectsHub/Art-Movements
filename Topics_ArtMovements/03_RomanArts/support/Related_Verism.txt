Verism (noun)

From the Latin word meaning “true,” verism is the name of a style of portraiture that is hyperrealistic and emphasizes individual features.

The Romans created veristic portraits of older men most likely because the style conveyed experience as well as indicating that the individual has met an age requirement to run for political office.
