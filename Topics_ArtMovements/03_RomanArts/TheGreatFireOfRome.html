			<h4>
Summary
			</h4>
			<p>
<b>The Fire's Origin and Spread:</b> The fire started in mid-July 64 CE in the heart of Rome, quickly spreading through the city's overcrowded and flammable structures.
	<br><br>
<b>Nero's Role:</b> There is debate over whether Emperor Nero purposely set the fire or merely presided over the disaster. Some accounts suggest Nero's men may have accelerated the destruction.
	<br><br>
<b>Historical Accounts:</b> Tacitus and Suetonius, two Roman historians, provide differing accounts of the fire. Tacitus is generally considered more reliable, as he was alive during the fire, while Suetonius was born after the event.
	<br><br>
<b>Firefighting Techniques:</b> The methods used by Nero's men, the vigiles, are questioned. Some believe they were creating firebreaks to stop the fire, while others think they were demolishing buildings to aid the fire's spread.
	<br><br>
<b>Modern Interpretations:</b> Modern historians tend to side with Tacitus's account, viewing the vigiles' actions as attempts to control the fire rather than a conspiracy by Nero.

		<h4>
Introduction
		</h4>
		<p>
Mid-July, 64 AD, in the heart of Rome, tragedy struck as fire erupted into a massive inferno. The blaze killed innumerable people and destroyed great swathes of the city fueling debates over its details which have persisted for nearly two thousand years.
	<br><br>
		</p>

		<h4>
Theories
		</h4>
		<p>
Perhaps most urgently, did <a href="./EmperorNero.html">Emperor Nero</a>, regent at the time, purposely set the city ablaze or merely preside over the disaster? The firefighting techniques used by Nero’s men have also been questioned as it remains unclear if they hoped to halt the blaze or accelerate the city’s destruction. 
	<br><br>
While the trustworthiness of contemporary accounts of the fire have long been questioned and debated, the academic community generally blames poor circumstances for Rome’s destruction, believing Tacitus’s account. Public consciousness, however, is still entranced by the enthralling tale depicting a gleeful Nero celebrating as Rome burned. 
	<br><br>
		</p>
		<h4>
Destruction and Aftermath
		</h4>
		<p>
First, we should imagine the fire itself in order to understand the significance of the destruction, confusion, and fear that enveloped Rome. Flames suffocated the city’s crowded streets for over a week. Masses of people surged in the canyons between winding towers of rickety tenements and even more wistful pillars of smoke and dust. 
	<br><br>
The roar of screaming people, the din of stampeding feet, and the blaze of the inferno replaced the metropolitan bustle of the Roman imperial center. The noise echoed in the narrow streets between apartment buildings, dying before it could rise from the valleys to the hilltops. Reflecting the demonic glow of the terror below, the pristine stone walls of the wealthy and awe-inspiring temples glowed burnt orange.
	<br><br>
The fire began in the cramped shops, emblematic of Roman urban overcrowding. The rickety structures were piled around the <a href="./Related_RomanArts.html#CircusMaximus">Circus Maximus</a>. Full of flammable wares and crops, they provided perfect kindling for the blaze. Quickly, flames raged through the heavily populated lower tenements and neighborhoods of the city. 
	<br><br>
Tacitus, a Roman historian alive during the Great Fire, told the story of the fleeing crowds. Referencing the mythical Greek Orpheus, Tacitus wrote:
	<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
“When people looked back, menacing flames sprang up before them or outflanked them.”
	<br>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
Those who looked back, as <a href="./Related_RomanArts.html#Orpheus">Orpheus</a> did to gaze at his wife Eurydice, were sent to the depths of the underworld by the flames. 
	<br><br>
Describing the maelstrom in his book The Great Fire of Rome, modern historian Joseph Walsh stated with morbid irony:
	<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
“The same layout and materials that made it easy for the fire to spread made it difficult for [Rome’s] residents to escape.”
	<br>
		</blockquote>
		<h4>
Nero’s Role
		</h4>
		<p>
In the throng, the imperial night watchmen, the <a href="./Related_RomanArts.html#Vigiles">vigiles</a> urbani, clubbed their way against the flood of fleeing plebeians; some fought the flames, others looted the abandoned buildings, and some seemed to be demolishing other buildings outside the fire’s path. Importantly, they all claimed to be under orders from the crown. 
	<br><br>
According to the Roman historian Suetonius (b. 69 AD), the vigiles’ methods seemed rather unorthodox as firefighting techniques, implying a destructive nature. Suetonius wove a tale depicting how the greedy and crooked Emperor Nero had employed his vigiles to knock down unburned stone buildings with their siege weapons and burn them even as the structures escaped the Great Fire’s wrath.
	<br><br>
Suetonius explained the reported acts of the vigiles by claiming Nero had wanted to demolish the cramped and aging city to raise a new Rome, a gleaming city straight from his imagination. 
	<br><br>
Tacitus, ever the skeptic in comparison, posited a different conclusion. In the absence of evidence to substantiate Suetonius, he wrote that perhaps such men acting “under orders,” had lied and may not have been vigiles at all. Instead of a massive imperial conspiracy, Tacitus imagines greedy opportunists merely “wanted to plunder unhampered” before the flames destroyed the abandoned riches left behind as people fled the flames. 
	<br><br>
Many opinions, including a large portion of popular culture, have sided with Suetonius’s account blaming the fire and all subsequent destruction on the Emperor Nero. With this conclusion, the fire stands as an indicator of Nero’s (and the Crown’s) inherent hedonism and remains a blazing symbol of certain unpopular and eccentric Roman emperors.
	<br><br>
Suetonius despised Nero so much he included in his account rumors that the young emperor longed to rename Rome “Neropolis,” and claimed the young emperor had Oedipal desire for an intimate relationship with his own mother. The list of Suetonius’s inditements against Nero, however, do not stop there. Without any remaining evidence to support his claims, his scornful account quickly begins to seem embellished. 
	<br><br>
		</p>
		<h4>
Modern Views
		</h4>
		<p>
Modern historians have come to a consensus that Tacitus, not Suetonius, is a more reliable source about the fire’s extent and the firefighting techniques implemented. Tacitus lived through the fire; he was alive during the conflagration unlike Suetonius who was not born until four years after the blaze. Tacitus’s writing also indicates a far less personal hatred of Nero, and he takes a more impartial stance towards the known and unknown aspects of the start of the fire and the tactics of the vigiles. 
	<br><br>
Suetonius, in a far more emotional and frantic rant, clearly wanted to destroy any positive or credible aspects of Nero’s existence. Tacitus seems to let his readers draw their own judgements rather than Suetonius’s literary inditement, making Tacitus appear more trustworthy. 
	<br><br>
Modern investigators are confronted with a basic problem: no physical evidence remains of the fire. Long gone are the possibilities of forensic tests, chemical traces, or witnesses to interview. We are left pasting together mentions from Tacitus, Suetonius, and other sources that span the centuries since the blaze. Objectivity, truth, and hard facts remain unattainable with so much time having passed. 
	<br><br>
Nevertheless, debate over the Great Fire stumbles on. Interpretation of old materials with new theories and approaches still grants new insights into the ancient world and includes otherwise overlooked people, cultures, and places in the historical narrative. 
	<br><br>
Rather recently, the prevailing opinion of Roman historians is now that the destruction of structures with siege weapons mentioned by Tacitus and Suetonius was most likely the vigiles attempt at creating a firebreak, not an imperial real estate scheme. 
	<br><br>
By destroying a path through the city, the vigiles had hoped to suffocate the fire, limiting its consumption of the city to within the boundaries of their firebreak and saving the city beyond. This insight has provided Roman historians with new insights into interpretation of other periods surrounding the fire and the opinions of the emperors.
	<br><br>
The Great Fire is an unquestionably important event in international history. For hundreds of years, it has signified a key moment when the Roman emperors truly became symbols of unencumbered hedonism. However, as may be the case here, even the most popular historical narratives must always be questioned and sometimes rewritten entirely.  
	<br><br>
		</p>
		<h4>
Myths About Nero and The Fire
		</h4>
		<p>
The accusation that Emperor Nero deliberately started the Great Fire of Rome is often considered a pervasive myth. According to those accounts, while the city burned, Nero observed from his palace, playing the lyre and singing about the fall of Troy. However, several factors debunk this scandalous narrative.
	<br><br>
Firstly, Nero’s palace on the Palatine Hill, being close to the fire’s origin, was among the first structures to succumb.
	<br><br>
Additionally, historical records (from the Historian Tacitus) indicate that Nero was in Antium (today’s Anzio, Italy) when the fire broke out and rushed back to organize relief efforts, making it unlikely for him to orchestrate the disaster.
	<br><br>
It must also be noted that the myth gained notoriety because contemporary sources for the Great Fire of Rome are lacking; surviving accounts were written decades later. Key sources suggesting Nero’s guilt, like Suetonius and Cassius Dio, were senators who disliked the emperor. Their bias raises questions about the accuracy of attributing blame to Nero, emphasizing the need for critical examination of historical accounts.
	<br><br>
In conclusion, the myth, though enduring, lacks substantial evidence and is considered a sensationalized aspect of the fire’s historical legacy.
	<br><br>

		<h4>
Influence on the Arts
		</h4>
		<h5>
Architectural Rebuilding
		</h5>
		<p>
The fire destroyed a significant portion of Rome, leading to extensive rebuilding efforts. Emperor Nero took advantage of this opportunity to redesign the city, constructing grander and more elaborate structures. This included the Domus Aurea (Golden House), a vast and opulent palace complex. The architectural innovations and grandeur of these new buildings influenced Roman architecture for generations to come.
	<br><br>
		</p>
		<h5>
Cultural Shifts
		</h5>
		<p>
Nero's reign and the fire's aftermath saw a shift in cultural attitudes. Nero was known for his artistic pursuits, including poetry, music, and acting. His involvement in the arts, however, drew criticism from the Roman elite, who viewed his interests as unbecoming of an emperor. This tension between traditional Roman values and Nero's artistic inclinations influenced cultural expressions and the perception of art in Roman society.
	<br><br>
		</p>
		<h5>
Christian Persecution
		</h5>
		<p>
The fire also had significant religious implications. Nero blamed the Christians for the fire, leading to widespread persecution. This persecution was depicted in various forms of art, including literature and later Christian iconography, which often portrayed Nero as a tyrant and persecutor of Christians.
	<br><br>
		</p>
		<h5>
Artistic Depictions
		</h5>
		<p>
The Great Fire of Rome has been depicted in numerous works of art over the centuries. Paintings, sculptures, and literary works have portrayed the chaos and destruction of the fire, as well as Nero's role in the events. These artistic depictions have helped shape the historical narrative and public perception of the fire and Nero's reign.
	<br><br>

		</p>
		<h5>
Influence on Later Art
		</h5>
		<p>
The fire and Nero's subsequent architectural projects influenced later Roman and Renaissance art. The grandeur and opulence of Nero's constructions inspired later artists and architects, who sought to emulate the grandiosity of Roman architecture.
	<br><br>
The Great Fire of Rome remains a significant event in history, not only for its immediate impact but also for its lasting influence on the arts and culture.
