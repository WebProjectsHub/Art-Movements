The Greek Temple
			</h1>
			<h4>
Summary
			</h4>
			<p>
<b>Structure:</b> Greek temples were typically oblong with a colonnade of columns on all sides. They had a front porch (pronaos) and a back porch (opisthodomos).
	<br><br>
<b>Materials:</b> Temples were built using local limestone and marble, with roofs covered in ceramic tiles. Columns were often made from limestone and decorated with marble.
	<br><br>
<b>Designs:</b> There were five basic temple designs: "in antis," prostyle, amphiprostyle, peripteral, and dipteral, each with different column arrangements.
	<br><br>
<b>Construction:</b> The construction process involved quarrying and transporting stone, precise carving, and painting the temples in vibrant colors. The architect oversaw all aspects of the building process.

		<h4>
Introduction
		</h4>
		<p>
Except for the circular <a href="">tholos</a>, most Greek temples were oblong, roughly twice as long as they were wide. Most were small (30â€“100 feet long), although a few were more than 300 feet long and 150 feet wide. (For comparison, the dimensions of the Parthenon are 235 feet in length, 109 feet in width.) The typical oblong floor plan incorporated a colonnade of columns (peristyle) on all four sides; a front porch (pronaos), a back porch (opisthodomos). The upper works of the temple usually consisted of mudbrick and wood, except for the upper facade which was usually stone, and designed according to the Order (Doric, Ionic). Columns were typically carved from limestone, with upper facades usually decorated with marble.

The interior of the Greek temple typically consisted of an inner shrine (cella, or naos) which housed the cult statue, and sometimes one or two antechambers, which were used as storage places for devotees to leave their votive offerings, like money, precious objects, and weapons.
	<br><br>
		</p>

		<h4>
Layout
		</h4>
		<p>
The layout of the inner shrine, the other chambers (if any) and surrounding columns usually followed one of five basic designs, named as follows:
		</p>
			<ul id="bulletListLink">
<li><b>
"Templum in antis" or "in antis".</b>
The entrance to the cella incorporates a pair of columns.  (Example: Siphnian Treasury, Delphi, 525 BC; or Temple of Hera, Olympia, 590 BC.) 
</li><br>
<li><b>
Prostyle temple.</b>
The entrance is preceded by a portico of columns across its front.  (Example: Temple B, Selinunte, Sicily, c.600-550 BC.)
</li><br>
<li><b>
Amphiprostyle temple.</b>
The entrance is preceded by a portico of columns across its front and there is a colonnade of columns at the rear exterior of the cella.  (Example: Temple of Athena Nike, Athens, 425 BC. Or see the later Temple of Venus and Roma, Rome, 141 AD.)
</li><br>
<li><b>
Peripteral temple.</b>
The colonnade surrounded the entire building.  (Example: The Parthenon, Athens, 447-437 BC)
</li><br>
<li><b>
Dipteral temple.</b> 
The colonnade encircling the building comprised a double row of columns.  (Example: The Heraion of Samos, 550 BC; or Temple of Apollo, Didyma, Asia Minor, 313 BC)
</li>
			</ul>
	<br>
		<h4>
Base and Walls
		</h4>
		<p>
The temple was built on a masonry base (crepidoma), which elevated it above the surrounding ground. The base usually consists of three steps: the topmost step is the "stylobate"; the two lower steps are the "stereobate". Like the Parthenon, most temples have a three-step base, although the Temple of Zeus at Olympus, has two, while the Temple of Apollo at Didyma has six. During the petrification process (650/600 BC onwards), temples were given masonry walls, consisting mostly of local stone rubble, sometimes augmented by high quality ashlar masonry. Inside the temple, the inner sanctum (cella/naos) was made of stone, as were the antechambers, if any.
	<br><br>
		<h4>
Roof
		</h4>
		<p>
All early temples had a flat thatched roof, supported by columns (hypostyle), but as soon as walls were made from stone and could therefore support a heavier load, temples were given a slightly sloping roof, covered with ceramic terracotta tiles. These roof tiles could be up to three-feet long and weigh as much as 80 pounds.
	<br><br>
		<h4>
Column and Lintel
		</h4>
		<p>
Greek architects and building engineers knew about both the "arch" (see, for instance, The Rhodes Footbridge, 4th century BC) and the "vault" (corbel and barrel types), but they made little use of either in their architectural construction. Instead, they preferred to rely on the use of "post and lintel" techniques, involving vertical uprights (columns or posts) supporting horizontal beams (lintels). This method, known as trabeated construction, dates back to earliest times when temples were made from timber and clay, and was later applied to stone posts and horizontal stone beams. However, it remained a relatively primitive method of roofing an area, since it required a large number of supporting columns.
	<br><br>
The stone columns themselves usually consisted of a series of solid stone "drums" - set one upon the other, without mortar - but sometimes joined inside with bronze pegs. The diameter of columns usually decreases from the bottom upwards, and to correct any illusion of concavity, Greek architects usually tapered them with a slight outward curve: an architectural technique known as <a href="">"entasis"</a>.
	<br><br>
Each column is composed of a shaft and a capital; some also have a base. The shaft may be decorated with vertical or spiral grooves, called fluting. The capital has two parts: a rounded lower part (echinus), above which is a square-shaped tablet (abacus). The appearance of the echinus and abacus varies according to the stylistic "template" or "Order" used in the temple's construction. Doric Order capitals are plainer and more austere, while Ionic and Corinthian capitals are more ornate.
	<br><br>
		<h4>
Entablature and Pediment
		</h4>
		<p>
The temple's columns support a two-tier horizontal structure: the "entablature" and the "pediment". The entablature - the first tier - is the major horizontal structural element supporting the roof, and encircles the whole building. It is made up of three sections. The lowest section is the "architrave", made up of a series of stone lintels which span the spaces between the columns. Each joint sits directly above the centre of each capital. The middle section is the "frieze", consisting of a broad horizontal band of relief sculpture. In Ionic and Corinthian temples, the frieze is continuous; in Doric temples sections of frieze (metopes) alternate with grooved rectangular blocks (triglyphs). The top part of the entablature immediately under the roof is the "cornice", which overhangs and protects the frieze.
	<br><br>
The second tier is the pediment, a shallow triangular structure occupying the front and rear gable of the building. Traditionally, this triangular space contained the most important sculptural reliefs on the exterior of the building.
	<br><br>
		<h4>
How Stone Temples Were Built
		</h4>
		<p>
The design and construction of Greek temples was dependent above all on local raw materials. Fortunately, although Ancient Greece possessed few forests, it had lots of limestone, which was easily worked. In addition, there were plentiful supplies (on the mainland and the islands of Paros and Naxos) of high grade white marble for architectural and sculptural decoration. Lastly, deposits of clay, used for both roof tiles and architectural decoration, were readily available throughout the country, notably around Athens.
	<br><br>
However, the quarrying and transport of stone was both costly and labour-intensive, and typically accounted for most of the cost of building a temple. It was only the wealth which Athens had accumulated after the Persian Wars, that enabled Pericles (495 - 429) to build the Parthenon (447 - 422 BC) and other stone monuments on the Acropolis, at Athens. In some cases, older stone monuments were cannibalized for their marble and other precious stones.
	<br><br>
Typically, each building project was controlled and supervised by the architect, who oversaw every aspect of construction. He selected the stone, managed its extraction, and supervised the craftsmen who cut and shaped it at the quarry. At the building site, master stone masons made the final precise carvings, to ensure that each stone block would slot into place without the need for mortar. After this, labourers hoisted each block into position. The architect also supervised the professional sculptors, who carved the reliefs on the frieze, metopes and pediments, as well as the painters who painted the sculptures and various architectural elements of the building.
	<br><br>
The Greeks regularly painted their marble temples. In fact they seem not only to have painted them, but to have used gaudy colours for the purpose, indulging generously in red, blue, and gold. There must have been some attempt to correlate colour and structure, with the structural members kept clear and outstanding, the lower parts little coloured, and the upper parts alone flowering in hue as they did in sculptural adornment, but all evidence has long since vanished.
