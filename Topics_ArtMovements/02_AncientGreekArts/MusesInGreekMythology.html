Introduction
			</h4>
			<p>
In Greek mythology, the Muses were a powerful group of goddesses who presided over the arts and sciences. Their influence on human creativity has been profound, shaping the course of artistic expression for centuries. Though no longer worshiped, they remain enduring symbols of inspiration and patronage.
	<br><br>
While the Muses originated as mythological figures, their impact transcends their ancient context. They have been celebrated and invoked by artists and scholars throughout European history, serving as a constant source of inspiration and a testament to the enduring power of myth. 
	<br><br>
The nine Muses, each associated with a specific art or science, have become iconic figures in their own right. Though some are more widely recognized than others, all were considered vital to the cultural life of ancient Greece. Their legacy continues to inspire artists and thinkers today, reminding us of the enduring power of creativity and the importance of honoring our cultural heritage.

				<h2>
					Calliope – Muse of Epic Poetry
				</h2>
				<p>
Calliope was one of the most prominent of all the Muses in Greek mythology as she was the figure who presided over Epic poetry. This was also why she was termed by some as the “Chief” of the Muses. The reason that epic poetry is such an important aspect of ancient Greek culture is because it was, in many ways, the bedrock of many of the most notable aspects of their culture.
	<br><br>
Calliope, in myth, was also the supposed mother of both Orpheus and Linus.
	<br><br>
The former of the two is one of the most important musical figures in ancient Greek mythology, and his voice was meant to exhibit such eloquence and harmony that he was greater than any other singer. The myth of Orpheus formed the basis of of one of the most influential mystery cults of ancient Greece.
	<br><br>
In terms of who Calliope was the supposed muse of in mythical accounts is quite a simple thing. She was the supposed muse of Homer, the most revered of all the ancient Greek epic poets, and the mythical author of the Iliad and the Odyssey. Her mythical role in the establishment of this immensely important literary figure has led to this particular Muse in Greek mythology to be one of the most notable.

				<h2>
					Clio – Muse of History
				</h2>
				<p>
Clio was considered to be the Muse of history, although there are also a few accounts that portray her as the muse of the lyre too. However, she has become far more closely associated with history. While contemporary thinkers generally do not consider history to be part of the arts, it was quite common for history to be seen as a part of culture and therefore an artform alongside various others.
	<br><br>
Whenever this particular Muse is depicted, she is generally shown with parchment, a scroll, or a book (essentially, something to write in), and a trumpet.
	<br><br>
She is also often depicted with a crown of laurels, especially because it was a prominent part of her iconography during the Baroque.
	<br><br>
In the mythological tradition, she had a son, Hyacinth, but he is not as famous as the sons of Calliope. In addition to this, thanks to the many often conflicting parts of ancient Greek mythology, she has been depicted as the mother of other figures, such as Linus. This is a common issue in much mythology as these stories were often part of the oral tradition and were therefore subject to change.

				<h2>
					Erato – Muse of Erotic and Lyric Poetry
				</h2>
				<p>
Erato is a name that comes from the same root word as another notable ancient Greek mythological figure whose name has since transcended his original purpose, Eros. This may give some indications about what Erato oversaw as one of the Muses in Greek mythology.
	<br><br>
Erato was the Muse of lyric poetry, with a specific focus on love poetry.
	<br><br>
Whenever she has been depicted, she has generally been shown holding a lyre while wearing a wreath of myrtle and roses. She has also often been depicted alongside turtle doves and has even sometimes been shown while holding an arrow (which further solidifies the connection between her and Eros, as the arrow of desire may come from her).
	<br><br>
She has become an important figure amongst the Greek Muses because of her appearing as a figure in various poems and love stories within the ancient Greek tradition. The erotic is often associated with love, and as such, she is an integral figure in the development of the arts that are geared toward love.

				<h2>
					Euterpe – Muse of Music and Lyric Poetry
				</h2>
				<p>
Euterpe is another of the Muses in Greek mythology who has an association with lyric poetry, but unlike Erato, she is also commonly associated with music. Euterpe is generally depicted alongside instruments, mostly wind instruments of which she was a supposed inventor.
	<br><br>
As the Muse of music and musicians, she was traditionally evoked to aid them in their compositions.
	<br><br>
Like the other Muses in Greek mythology, Euterpe is said to have lived on Mounts Parnassus and Helicon instead of Mount Olympus, but alongside Apollo as god of music, they provided entertainment for the Olympian gods. However, thanks to the aforementioned oral tradition of Greek mythology, they are also sometimes placed on Mount Olympus. However, her role as a great artist never alters.

				<h2>
					Melpomene – Muse of Tragedy
				</h2>
				<p>
Melpomene is one of the most important Muses in Greek mythology in drama because of her association with tragedy. In some of the earliest stories that relate to her, she was the Muse of the chorus, but she started to shift to be seen as the Muse of tragedy instead. This has become the predominant way in which she is depicted to this day.
	<br><br>
Thanks to her association with the dramatic tragedy, she is often depicted wearing a tragic mask and the boots that were traditionally used by actors in tragic theater. She is also often shown with a knife or club in one of her hands. Her role in tragedy would have made her important in the many theatrical festivals held in Ancient Greece.
	<br><br>
According to some myths, Melpomene was the mother of the monsters known as Sirens.
	<br><br>
These tragic figures are perhaps best known for luring sailors to their deaths through their beautiful songs. The Muse of tragedy is the perfect entity to serve as the mother of some of these famous mythical creatures.

				<h2>
					Polyhymnia – Muse of Hymns and Sacred Poetry
				</h2>
				<p>
Polyhymnia, as her name suggests, was the Muse of hymns and other sacred poetry. In addition, she has an association with the pantomime as well as agriculture. While the latter association may seem strange, keep in mind that many sacred festivals and rituals where hymns would be sung, were closely allied to the agricultural calendar.
	<br><br>
Ancient peoples relied on the gods to keep droughts, floods, and other impediments to raising and harvesting their crops at bay.
	<br><br>
She is usually depicted in a more pensive manner with a finger to her mouth, a veil and cloak over her, and her elbow leaning on a pillar. Her more restrained nature translates to her patronage of sacred poetry.

					Terpsichore – Muse of Dancing and Chorus
				</h2>
				<p>
Terpsichore is the Muse of dancing, although she is also often associated with the chorus, which is a now lesser-known aspect of Greek drama. In antiquity, choral groups of people singing and dancing formed a major part of various cultural and religious festivals.
	<br><br>
Whenever she is depicted in the arts, she is usually shown to be sitting down while holding a lyre as it was a common instrument used in creating music for dancing. Her role as the Muse of dancing would have integral importance in dramatic fields as dance was a common part of these arts.
	<br><br>
Terpsichore was another of the Greek Muses described as mother of the Sirens, and in some myths, she the mother of Biston the Thracian king.

					Thalia – Muse of Comedy

				<p>
Thalia is another of the Muses in Greek mythology that is strongly associated with ancient Greek drama as she is the Muse of comedy. In addition, she is often associated with idyllic poetry, which shares some roots with comedy as a more pleasant and entertaining part of the arts over many of the more tragic forms.
	<br><br>
She was generally portrayed with a comic mask, a crown of ivy, boots, and sometimes a trumpet. She was said to support actors as they performed.
	<br><br>
Thalia is not as commonly depicted as some of the other Muses. In terms of her own children, she was supposedly the mother of the Corybantes (while the father was Apollo).

					Urania – Muse of Astronomy
				</h2>
				<p>
Urania is the Muse of astronomy, and so those who were inspired by her were those who studied the heavens. Urania was credited with inventing the globe and a compass, which are important tools in understanding the stars above us.
	<br><br>
She is often depicted with a star-embroidered cloak, her eyes affixed to the heavens, and a celestial globe. In much of modern art, she is often shown with stars above her head.
	<br><br>
Her name derives from her great-grandfather, Uranus, the primordial god of the sky. She is said to have inherited immense power from her father, Zeus, who is also associated with the sky. Her divination abilities inspired many philosophers.

				<p>
The Muses are the nine goddesses of the arts and sciences from ancient Greek mythology. They were gods in their own right, and they were often seen as the inspiration behind many great pieces of art. That was, typically, their role in ancient Greek culture. They were said to inspire poets, singers, and philosophers and were therefore the patrons of the arts and the sciences.

					Legends and Stories of the Muses
				</h2>
				<p>
The Classical Muses were believed to live on Mt. Olympus where they entertained their father and the other Olympian gods with their great artistry and extensive knowledge, but later tradition also placed them on Mt. Helicon in Boeotia where there was a major cult centre to the goddesses, or on Mt. Parnassus where the Castalian spring was a favourite destination for poets and artists. On Mount Olympus, Apollo Mousagetes was, in a certain sense, the choir leader of the Muses, although his attachment was not limited to music, as he fathered many children with his musical group. Calliope, the Muse of epic poetry, was the mother of Orpheus, the wonderfully gifted lyre player whose father was said by some to be Apollo himself.
	<br><br>
Although bringers of festivity and joy, the Muses were not to be trifled with when it came to the superiority of their artistic talents. The nine daughters of Pierus foolishly tried to compete musically with the Muses on Mt. Helicon and were all turned into birds for their impertinence. The Thracian musician Thamyres (son of the Nymph Agriope) was another who challenged the Muses in music and after inevitably coming second best to the goddesses was punished with blindness, the loss of his musical talent, and his singing voice. This myth was also the subject of a tragedy by Sophocles. The Muses also acted as judges in another musical competition, this time between Apollo on his kithara and the satyr Marsyas, who played the aulos given to him by Athena. Naturally, Apollo won and Marsyas was flayed alive for his troubles.

					The Muses in Greek Art
				</h2>
				<p>
In ancient Greece, music, and by association the Muses, were held in great esteem and music was played in homes, in theatres, during religious ceremonies, to accompany athletics, provided rhythm during military training, accompanied agricultural activities such as harvesting, and was an important element in the education of children. For example, Themistocles, the great Athenian politician and general, considered his education incomplete because he could not play the khitara. Throughout the ancient Greek world musical festivals and competitions were held in honour of the Muses and philosophical schools bore their name: the Mouseia.

In art, the Muses are depicted as beautiful young women, often with wings. The Muses often appear on 5th and 4th century BC red- and black-figure pottery, in particular in scenes with Apollo playing his kithara or representations of the Marsyas and Thamyres myths. Many statues of the Muses have been found on Delos, an important cult centre to Apollo. In addition, in the 5th century BC, the iconography of the ideal woman in Greek art came very close to that of a Muse. Music and, therefore, also the Muses, frequently appear as a subject on lekythoi, the elegant funerary vases, which were placed in graves so that loved ones might have the pleasure of music on their journey into the next life. A celebrated representation of the Muses as a group is the three marble reliefs from a statue base, dating to c. 325 - 300 BC and now housed in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens.

					The Muses in Greek Mythological Works
				</h2>
				<p>
The Muses in Greek mythology may have been important figures in the development of much of ancient Greek art, but they were also directly referenced and found within pieces of art from ancient Greece. For instance, the Greek Muses are directly mentioned in Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey when the famed ancient Greek poet directly invoked the Muses to aid him in telling the stories that he wished to tell through his epic poems. He asked for their divine intervention.
	<br><br>
Furthermore, the Muses can be found in the work of Hesiod, another ancient Greek poet and the first known source of their number as nine.  His work, Theogony, is directly related to the origins of the gods themselves, and he claims that he met the Muses when he was tending to his flock as a shepherd. They supposedly told him about the genealogy of the gods, and that would be immensely important in understanding and writing about them as figures in what was a widely-practiced religion at the time.
	<br><br>
Aside from these ancient figures in Greek art, the Muses have also been depicted in sculptures and paintings, such as the Muses Sarcophagus (2nd century CE), a Roman sarcophagus that is now in the Louvre or the Parnassus fresco (1509 – 1511) by Raphael which depicts the Muses. These are only two examples of later works that depict the Greek Muses. The Muses have gone on to be an inspiration for many artists throughout the centuries.

					Temples and Sanctuaries Dedicated to the Muses
				</h2>
				<p>
The Muses in Greek mythology were gods, and as such, there were locations that were dedicated to them as places of worship in ancient Greece. While they may no longer be worshiped as actual gods who could have an actual influence on actual artists, the places where they were worshiped have remained important in understanding ancient Greek mythology.
	<br><br>
One of the most important of all of these locations was the aptly named Valley of the Muses.
	<br><br>
This location could be found beside Mount Helicon, and it was the location of an important Muse-oriented festival called the Mouseia. Every fifth year, this festival was held to honor them and there were various games and contests held there. The central temple contained statues of the Muses, but they were later removed by Constantine the Great to Constantinople.
	<br><br>
Another important location was the Temple at Delphi. While this particular temple is far more associated with Apollo, the Muses were considered to be immensely important for knowledge, and so there was a shrine in Delphi meant to be a place for learning and composition of poetry. Many historical figures gathered at this location, including Sophocles and Euripides. There were also locations dedicated to the Muses in many major cities and locations, from Athens to Sparta.
	<br><br>
At these locations, the Muses were generally worshiped through various offerings and rituals. This was common for practically every god, and there would be sacrifices (of both animal and non-animal varieties), recitation of poetry and hymns in their honor, dances, and libations poured out as ritual offerings.
	<br><br>
While the Muses were worshiped, they were also integral to the many festivals that formed part of ancient Greek culture. The Mouseia has already been mentioned, but they also formed an integral part of festivals such as the drama-oriented Dionysian festival, the musical and athletic Pythian Games, and the contests such as the Panathenaia. As the nine goddesses of the arts, the Muses and their influence on culture and art is understandable.

				<h2>
					The Muses in Modern Culture
				</h2>
				<p>
The Muses in Greek mythology have remained some of the most important figures in the mythological tradition of an already immensely important culture. For this reason, the Greek Muses have remained important in the arts. For instance, there are direct sources of inspiration that can be seen in groups, such as the band Muse (which is literally named after these nine goddesses of the arts).
	<br><br>
Other important pieces of popular culture that make use of the Greek Muses in some way include the Margaret Atwood novella The Penelopiad, which is a retelling of the story of Odysseus from the perspective of the famous figure’s wife, or the John Keats poem Ode to Psyche, which is a tribute to the Muses. Perhaps one of the best more contemporary examples is the Disney film Hercules, which depicts the Muses as important figures that narrate the story of Hercules to the audience.
	<br><br>
With the exception of small groups of Neo-pagans, Muse-worship no longer occurs. The modern usage of the word “muse” refers to an aspect of the creative process, or to denote a relationship between a creative individual and someone they credit as a source of inspiration.
	<br><br>
The contemporary understanding of the term “muse” is generally a metaphor, but there have been a number of figures who have claimed that certain individuals have been muses to them in some or another sense. However, in this sense, it is less of a mythical reasoning and more of a form of love and adoration that an artist may wish a certain person to have for them that spurns them to create.
	<br><br>
And at last, we come to the conclusion of our discussion about the Muses in Greek mythology. We have examined the names of Muses, what each Muse was responsible for, how they influenced various figures, and how they are still seen to this day. Each Muse of art has their own story and place in ancient Greek mythology, but their depiction has influenced countless artists throughout the centuries, and there will likely be depictions of them further into the future.
