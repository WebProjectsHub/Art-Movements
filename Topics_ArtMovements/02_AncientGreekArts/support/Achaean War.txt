The Achaean League was a Hellenistic period confederation of Greek city states on the northern and central Peloponnese between 280 BCE and 146 BCE.

The League remained loyal to Macedon in the First Macedonian War (212-205 BC) between Rome and Mecedon. This was an unwise move as Philip V's Macedonian army was defeated. The Achaeans then pragmatically switched sides in the Second Macedonian War (200-196 BCE) and supported Rome. This time finding itself on the winning side, the League had to carefully balance its ambitions with the new wider political situation. Around 196 BC Rome and the League signed a treaty of alliance.

A Third Macedonian War (171-167 BC) brought another Roman victory on the Battle of Pydna (168 BC) and Greece was well on the road to become nothing more than a Roman province.


The Achaean War of 146 BC was the result of a basic misunderstanding between the Achaean League of Peloponnesian Greek states and the Roman Republic in terms of Achaean political autonomy. Achaean statesmen believed they had room for independent action, whereas the Romans expected the league to act as an inferior ally and carry out warfare and diplomacy only after consultation with the Roman Senate. The immediate issue was of long standing: the incorporation of secessionist Sparta into the league. In 146 Achaean leaders declared war on Sparta and forced it back into league membership. This action was undertaken without Roman permission, and the Romans acted swiftly in reprisal, crushing Achaean forces militarily and destroying the Achaean city of Corinth. The Achaean War led to the diminution of the Achaean League and the creation of Achaea as a client-state of Rome.
