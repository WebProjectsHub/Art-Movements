Ancient Greece refers to a civilization that existed from the Greek Dark Ages (around the 12th-9th centuries BCE) to the end of classical antiquity (approximately 600 CE). This civilization was located in the northeastern Mediterranean and comprised a collection of culturally and linguistically related city-states and territories¹².

Key aspects of Ancient Greece include:

Political Developments: The concept of democracy was pioneered in Athens.
Military Conflicts: Notable wars include the Persian Wars and the Peloponnesian War.
Hellenistic Period: Following the conquests of Alexander the Great, Greek culture spread across the Mediterranean and Near East²³.
