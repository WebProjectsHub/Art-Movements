****************
Definition and Origin: Amphorae are jars with two vertical handles used in antiquity for storing and transporting foodstuffs like wine and olive oil. The design originated from the eastern Mediterranean and was adopted by the Greeks.

Types and Evolution: There are two basic types: neck-amphora and belly amphora. Over time, the design evolved to become taller and slimmer for easier packing and identification of contents.

Uses: Amphorae were used to transport various foodstuffs and non-food items. They were also used in tombs and for other purposes like building foundations.

Archaeological Significance: Amphorae provide valuable information for dating sites, understanding trade relations, and studying ancient diets. They often have stamps indicating origin, content, and quality.

Imagine a vessel, shaped like a slender, two-handled urn, its walls as sturdy as a soldier's shield. It has witnessed the rise and fall of empires, the ebb and flow of trade, and the daily rituals of countless generations. This is the amphora, a testament to human ingenuity and necessity.

From the sun-drenched shores of Phoenicia to the grandeur of Rome, the amphora has been the silent partner in countless journeys. Laden with the precious nectar of the grape or the golden liquid of the olive, it has braved treacherous seas and perilous land routes, its contents a symbol of wealth and prosperity.

Yet, the amphora is more than just a utilitarian object. It is a time capsule, preserving the secrets of the past. Buried beneath the sands of time, these ancient vessels have revealed the dietary habits, trade networks, and even the religious practices of our ancestors. Each amphora is a piece of a puzzle, a fragment of a story waiting to be pieced together by the patient hands of archaeologists.

Designs
From the vast, bronze-age pithoi of the Minoans and Mycenaeans, the amphora emerged as the ubiquitous pottery shape of antiquity. Yet, its form was as diverse as its uses. While some were plain, utilitarian vessels for transporting goods, others were adorned with intricate black-figure or red-figure designs.

Certain regions, renowned for their pottery production—Corinth, Attica, and the wine-producing islands of Chios, Lesbos, and Samos—each developed their own distinctive amphora styles. Colonies in the Black Sea and Magna Graecia followed suit, though some cities simply copied proven designs.

All amphorae were crafted on the potter's wheel in stages, each section allowed to dry before the next was added. There were two primary types: the neck-amphora, with a sharp angle between the shoulder and neck, and the belly amphora, with a continuous curve. Vessels with wide mouths were known as kadoi or stamnoi, while plain transport amphorae were called amphoreus.

As the amphora evolved to better serve its primary function—wine storage and transport—its form became more practical. The base developed a pointed spike, the vessel grew taller and slimmer, and during the Roman period, the shape itself became an indicator of the contents. Decorative amphorae with pointed bases required bronze stands or ceramic rings to keep them upright.


Functions
The amphora, a vessel of ancient Greece and Rome, was a cornerstone of commerce and culture. Its average capacity was a modest twenty to twenty-five liters, though early examples were considerably larger. The practical necessity of transporting these vessels by hand, often with the aid of a yoke or strap, limited their size. Standardization, while attempted, remained elusive until the Byzantine era.

Amphorae were veritable cornucopias, containing a diverse array of foodstuffs. Wine, olive oil, honey, milk, olives, dried fish, cereals, and even water were all common contents. Beyond sustenance, they housed pitch and served as funerary urns for the deceased. The Panathenaic amphora, a grand vessel of thirty-six liters adorned with black-figure designs, held olives and served as a prize in the prestigious Panathenaic Games. Miniature amphorae, known as amphoriskoi or pelikai, were used to store precious perfumes.

Rome, following the Greek example, employed amphorae for similar purposes. However, the addition of Roman staples like fish sauce (garum) and preserved fruits necessitated new sealing methods. Clay or resin stoppers were employed, and some amphorae even boasted ceramic lids. While lids are rare, those that survive often feature a single knob handle, sometimes shaped like a fruit.

In a testament to their versatility, amphorae were repurposed for tasks far removed from their original design. They were buried whole in marshy ground to provide solid foundations for buildings and walls, and they served as structural elements in roof domes. The amphora, a simple yet enduring vessel, played a vital role in the ancient world, shaping commerce, culture, and even the very fabric of cities.


Stamps

The amphora, a vessel as ubiquitous in the ancient world as the tin can is today, was more than just a container. It was a passport, a receipt, a quality assurance stamp, and a taxman's nightmare. 

Before being fired, most amphorae were marked with a stamp, often on the neck, rim, or handles. This was more than mere decoration. It was a coded message, identifying the pottery workshop, the batch number, the quality control official, and even the guaranteed volume and quality of the contents. The name or monogram of the manufacturer might appear, along with a month or a regional symbol. Wine amphorae were particularly detailed, indicating the age of the vintage for finer wines and the "drink-by" date for cheaper fare.

These stamps weren't just for show. They were a tool of control, a way for authorities to keep tabs on customs duties. Stoppers were often stamped for the same purpose. And when stamps weren't enough, the Romans resorted to painting labels directly onto the vessels, leaving no doubt as to their contents.

For archaeologists, these markings are a treasure trove of information. By studying the stamps and labels, they can date a site with remarkable precision, especially shipwrecks. The quantity and origin of amphorae found can even reveal the extent of ancient trade networks.

The Monte Testaccio in Rome, a colossal mound of amphora shards, stands as a testament to the ubiquity and importance of this humble vessel. It's a staggering reminder that the amphora was more than just a container; it was a cornerstone of ancient civilization.
