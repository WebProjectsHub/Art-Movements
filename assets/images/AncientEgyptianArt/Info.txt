The ankh was used as a hieroglyph to write the words "live," "alive," or "life." It also became a popular symbol for life in general. In its center, the ankh-sign here features a cartouche (a protective oval-shaped ring) with the name of King Thutmose IV, in whose tomb it was found.

The djed-pillar is a stylized representation of an early fetish that probably consisted of plant material. From the beginning of ancient Egyptian history, it was used as a symbol signifying permanence. Later it was associated with the god Osiris and identified as his backbone. The djed-pillar here was probably used as a funerary amulet to ensure permanence and to closely connect the deceased to Osiris, who was revived after death.

This quartzite relief appears to depict the ritual called "Striking the Ball". A king wearing the royal nemes head-cloth with uraeus and the traditional bull’s tail stands on the right. Between him and a goddess opposite is the god hieroglyph and, lower down, a round ball. The goddess wears a uraeus on her forehead and holds an ankh and a was scepter. The latter is by this time usually held only by gods, although precursors of this particular scene show the goddess with a was, and certain important goddesses may hold was scepters. Remnants of her epithets are preserved.

The ball represents the evil eye of the serpent Apopy who wants to stop the sun bark in its travels, which would be a cosmic disaster. Although this scene is somewhat incomplete, or possibly under revision, the king usually holds a stick in one hand against a ball held in the other, on the verge of batting the ball / eye far away. The goddess, generally Hathor, offers her divine support.

The soft form of the raised relief and the goddess’s jutting breast are indications the relief dates to the Ptolemaic Period. Magnificent hard stone temples are a striking feature of Dynasty 30 and the early Ptolemaic Period, and belong particularly to the Delta region.

The ankh (life), djed (stability), and was (dominion) symbols depicted here on the sign for a heb bowl constitute a powerful combination of wishes that, before the first millennium, were offered by the king to a god or by a god to a king. Large complex inscribed examples of overlaid faience ankh, djed, and was elements from the time of the 25th and early 26th dynasty indicate the symbol is being associated with the Egyptian New Year, and one bears the name off Mentuemhat, the greatest official in the land.

Other elaborately carved faience examples may be uninscribed, and this one, though quite simple, was covered in gold. The date of these is uncertain, but they may belong to a continued function of the symbol as a New Year's offering, perhaps presented to a god in a temple. The festival association is strengthened by the fact that the bowl beneath the tall signs is not the standard neb basket but the heb bowl, which is the hieroglyph for festival.

This scarab was found in the same coffin as the statuettes of Amenemhab (26.7.1413a, b) and Huwebenef (26.7.1414a, b). An interesting mixture of designs indicates the lively individuality of artworks made during this transitional period. The back type, which has no indication of the beetle's wing cases, is typical of Second Intermediate Period scarabs found in the Nile Delta, and the rope pattern framing the design on the base had been used since the Middle Kingdom; both of these designs continued into early Dynasty 18. The winged scarab on the base is a new feature that becomes more common during the reigns of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III. The notches on the beetle's carefully delineated wing cases are found regularly on the backs of scarabs dating to their joint reign.

This papyrus is inscribed for a priest of the god Horus named Imhotep. His coffin was found in 1913 at the cemetery of Meir, and this papyrus, along with a second (35.9.21a–o), most likely comes from his burial.

Imhotep's Book of Coming forth by Day, commonly known as a Book of the Dead, was designed to help Imhotep make a successful transition from death to eternal life, and to ensure his safety and well-being in the realm of the dead. Written in a cursive script known as hieratic and read from right to left, it is divided into 182 columns, each containing one or more spells, incantations, or prayers. A continuous frieze of vignettes along the top, as well as larger drawings filling the height of the papyrus, illustrate or substitute for individual spells. Neither texts nor images follow a narrative sequence, but instead represent a compilation of spells grouped, to some extent, by theme.

The tit symbol (pronounced teet) illustrates a knotted piece of cloth whose early meaning is unknown, but in the New Kingdom it was clearly associated with the goddess Isis, the great magician and wife of Osiris. By this time, the tit was also associated with blood of Isis. The tit sign was considered a potent symbol of protection in the afterlife and the Book of the Dead specifies that the tit be made of blood-red stone, like this example, and placed at the deceased's neck.

Knots were widely used as amulets because the Egyptians believed they bound and released magic.

This is one of four stelae found near the doorway of the brick chapel of the family of Saiah, a wab, or purification priest of Amun who lived during the latter half of the 22nd Dynasty. The original tomb in whose courtyard this chapel was built dates to the 11th Dynasty, over a millennium earlier. All of the stelae are made of wood, painted in green, red, yellow and black on a white gesso ground.

Inscribed for Saiah himself, this stela is painted on both sides. On the front, the deceased, to viewer right, presents a heart-shaped object to a figure of the falcon-headed god Re-Harakhty-Atum, who sits on a cubic throne atop a reed mat. Before the god is a table piled high with offerings, and standing behind him is the goddess of the West, Imentet. In the lunette of the stela is a winged sun disk, two wedjat eyes (eyes of Horus), and two shen rings, symbols of eternity. The inscription above the offering table asks that Re-Harakhty-Atum, lord of the Two Lands and of Iunu (Heliopolis) give offerings. Above Saiah's head is written, "the Osiris, the purification priest of Amun who has no fault, Siah, son of Djed-Bastetankh."

On the back are two registers. In the bottom register, the goddess of the sycomore stands and pours water into the outstretched hand of a male figure seated to viewer right, most likely Saiah himself; a second identical male figure sits to the left, but there is a loss in the area between the goddess and the human, with only a bit of a libation vessel preserved. Above is the sun bark, held up by a kneeling god flanked by two kneeling goddess, presumably Isis and her sister Nephthys. Standing figures of Saiah with his arms raised in prayer frame the upper register; before the figure to the left is inscribed, "Worship by the purification priest of Amun, Saiah."

The_judgement_of_the_dead_in_the_presence_of_Osiris.jpg
The scene reads from left to right. To the left, Anubis brings Hunefer into the judgement area. Anubis is also shown supervizing [sic] the judgement scales. Hunefer's heart, represented as a pot, is being weighed against a feather, the symbol of Maat, the established order of things, in this context meaning 'what is right'. The ancient Egyptians believed that the heart was the seat of the emotions, the intellect and the character, and thus represented the good or bad aspects of a person's life. If the heart did not balance with the feather, then the dead person was condemned to non-existence, and consumption by the ferocious 'devourer', the strange beast shown here which is part-crocodile, part-lion, and part-hippopotamus.

However, as a papyrus devoted to ensuring Hunefer's continued existence in the Afterlife is not likely to depict this outcome, he is shown to the right, brought into the presence of Osiris by his son Horus, having become 'true of voice' or 'justified'. This was a standard epithet applied to dead individuals in their texts. Osiris is shown seated under a canopy, with his sisters Isis and Nephthys. At the top, Hunefer is shown adoring a row of deities who supervise the judgement."

The north wall of the burial chamber depicts three separate scenes, ordered from right to left.  In the first, Ay, Tutankhamen's successor, performs the "opening of the mouth" ceremony on Tutankhamen, who is depicted as Osiris, lord of the underworld.  In the middle scene, Tutankhamen, dressed in the costume of the living king, is welcomed in the realm of the gods by the goddess Nut.  On the left, Tutankhamen, followed by his ka (spirit twin), is embraced by Osiris.

Etruscan_-_Pyxis_and_lid_with_sphinx-shaped_handle_-_Walters_71489_-_Three_Quarter.jpg

This pyxis (box) was fashioned in imitation of Phoenician luxury goods imported from the Near East. Although it incorporates many Near Eastern elements in its decoration, including sphinxes, a lotus plant, and chariots, the style of the figures shows it is clearly the product of a local Etruscan workshop. The handle of the lid takes the form of a standing sphinx wearing a lotus crown. The 7th and early 6th centuries BC are known as the Orientalizing period because of the many eastern, or "Oriental," elements in the art. In this prosperous era of international trade, Etruscan artists manufactured luxury goods, such as those seen in this case, that reflect influences from the art of the eastern Mediterranean.

The Rosetta Stone is an incomplete grey and pink granodiorite stela dating from 196 BCE which presents a priestly decree concerning King Ptolemy V of Egypt. The text is in three different versions: Hieroglyphic, Demotic and Greek. The stone was discovered at Port Saint Julien, el-Rashid (Rosetta) on the Nile Delta in Egypt in 1799 CE by Pierre Francois Xavier Bouchard. Thomas Young first identified some of the hieroglyphs related to Ptolemy V but the full text was deciphered by Jean-François Champollion in the early 1820s CE and so the meaning of Egyptian hieroglyphs, lost for 1600 years, was finally re-discovered
