Characteristics: Depiction of royalty and gods, symmetrical composition, use of hieroglyphics

Influences: Religion, politics
			</h6>
			<p>
Ancient Egyptian art is known for its precise and detailed depictions of their rulers and gods. They were also skilled in sculpture, architecture and the use of hieroglyphics. There were no unique artistic styles recognized to be attributed to individual artists. Rather, the Ancient Egyptians created artworks based on the conventions that were held at the time. They aimed to represent the relationships between humans, kings and the gods.
	<br><br>
The arrival of the Greeks and Romans in Egypt led to a fusion of styles and techniques. The ancient Egyptians made carvings and sculptures and used pigments to paint on tombstone walls.
	<br><br>
The Ancient Egyptian period spanned thousands of years and can be divided into eight periods and dynasties, with different pharaohs and political leaders.

			<h1>
				Ancient Greek Art
			</h1>
			<h6>
				Time period: Ancient
				<br>
				Centuries: 900 to 330 BC
			</h6>
			<h6>
Characteristics: Idealisation of human form, focus on philosophy and mythology
	<br><br>
Influences: Philosophy, athletics, politics
			</h6>
			<p>
Ancient Greek art focused heavily on the human form, often depicting athleticism in a realistic but idealized manner. The Greeks were also known for their intricate sculptures and pottery designs. The Ancient Greeks developed the contrapposto technique in sculpture, which was a natural pose, whereby the figure rests their weight on one knee. This post created a sense of balance and realism in their sculptures. The contrapposto technique was later picked up by artists from the Renaissance and Neoclassical periods.
	<br><br>
Ancient Greek art can be further categorized into the Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic periods. The Archaic period saw the introduction of new techniques such as marble carving, while the Classical period is known for its portrayal of motion and emotion in sculpture and painting. The Hellenistic period saw an influence from Eastern cultures, leading to more elaborate designs and decorative elements. The Greeks used encaustic and tempera painting mediums and substrates such as wooden boards to create portraits, figural scenes and still lifes.

			<h1>
				Renaissance
			</h1>
			<h6>
				Time period: Renaissance
				<br>
				Centuries: 14th to the 17th centuries
				<br><br>
				Notable artists: Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo
			</h6>

			<p>
The Renaissance art movement, characterized by realism and classical themes, emerged in Italy during the 14th century and spread throughout Europe. 
<br><br>
During this period, there came a renewed interest in classical studies of Greek and Roman literature and art. The Mannerism period which marked the end of the Renaissance was characterized by expressiveness, theatricality and artificiality, which began to diverge from the style of the High Renaissance.
	<br><br>
Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello were some of the most influential figures in the Renaissance art movement. Their works often depicted classical themes, mythology and religious subjects. Their paintings demonstrated naturalistic techniques such as linear perspective to create a sense of depth in their paintings and sculptures.
	<br><br>
Artists began to work with oil paints in this period and from working with this new medium came new paint application techniques that are still taught today. Artists would paint in layers, using techniques such as glazing. Techniques such as sfumato, where oil paints are blended to create a smoky appearance were invented by da Vinci. Sfumato was a technique used in the painting of the Mona Lisa, around her mouth to create the illusion of a smile. The famous Mona Lisa, which came out of the High Renaissance period is regarded as the most famous painting in the world.

			<h6>
				Time period: Post-Renaissance
				<br>
				Centuries: 17th century
				<br><br>
				Notable artists: Rembrandt, Caravaggio, Vermeer
			</h6>

			<p>
The Baroque style followed, featuring exaggerated motion and clear detail to produce drama, emotion, and tension. Baroque paintings were often theatrical and used symbolism to convey narratives.
<br><br>
The Dutch Golden Age, a time of great prosperity in the Netherlands, saw artists like Rembrandt become famous for their portraits and genre scenes. Baroque art also spread to Catholic countries such as Italy. Caravaggio used the chiaroscuro or ‘tenebrism‘ techniques. This is the use of dramatic lighting and contrasted values to create emotion and tension in a scene. Portrait artists still use this technique today.

			</h6>

			<p>
Rococo art emerged in France as a more lighthearted and playful art style, which contrasted with the serious and classical styles of the Baroque period. Pastel colors, ornate details, and scenes of leisure and pleasure characterize the Rococo art style. Artists often portrayed romanticized scenes of aristocratic parties, music concerts, and outdoor excursions in their paintings and sculptures. Notable Rococo artists include Jean-Antoine Watteau and François Boucher.			</p>

			<h1>
				Neoclassicism
			</h1>
			<h6>
				Time period: Post-Renaissance
				<br>
				Centuries: 18th to 19th century
				<br><br>
				Notable artists: Jacques Louis David, John Flaxman
			</h6>

			<p>
Neoclassicism came about as a reaction against the vanity, frivolity and excess of the Rococo movement. Neoclassical artists looked to classical art and culture, particularly Ancient Roman and Greek, for inspiration and used it to convey moral messages and values.
<br><br>
The 18th and 19th centuries were labeled the periods of enlightenment due to the abundance of scientific discoveries across this time period. Artists wanted their artworks to live up to the standards of the Romans’ and Greeks’ art.
<br><br>
Neoclassical art often features heroic figures from history or mythology, depicted seriously with strong lines and minimal colors.
<br><br>
The neoclassical style spread throughout Europe and beyond, influencing movements such as the American Federal style in architecture.

			<h1>
				Romanticism
			</h1>
			<h6>
				Time period: Post-Renaissance
				<br>
				Centuries: 18th to 19th century
				<br><br>
				Notable artists: Eugene Delacroix, Caspar David Friedrich
			</h6>

			<p>
Romanticism was an art style that emphasized emotion and individual expression. The art movement was spurred by a desire for liberty during times of political upheaval, such as the French Revolution. 
<br><br>
This art movement came about against the backdrop of the Industrial Revolution; artists were reacting to societal norms of the Age of Enlightenment, where the course of human history was changed by new scientific discoveries, rationalization of nature and the modern sprawl of society.
<br><br>
Romantic artists depicted scenes of drama and passion, often including elements of nature or the supernatural. They also delved into personal emotions and expressions through self-portraits and depictions of the human psyche. Notable Romantic artists include Eugene Delacroix and Caspar David Friedrich who are known for their use of dramatic scenes and emotive subject matter. Caspar David Friedrich painted ethereal-looking scenes, of morning mist, ruins and mysterious figures in the landscape.
<br><br>
The Romantic movement was widespread throughout Europe and had a lasting impact on future art movements such as Symbolism and Expressionism. The themes in Romantic art are often the emphasis on sublimity in nature, individualism, emotion and the past.
<br><br>
The Romanticism art movement used medievalism as a source of inspiration, idealizing fantasy, spontaneity and visceral reactions to the environment to revolt against the progressive rationalism at the time. The Romantic art style served almost as an escapism from the industrialized society.			</p>

				Academic Art
			</h1>
			<h6>
				Time period: Post-Renaissance
				<br>
				Centuries: 16th to 19th century
				<br><br>
				Notable artists: Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, William-Adolphe Bouguereau
			</h6>

			<p>
Academic art is an art style and method of teaching art developed in the 19th century. The Academies were official institutions where artists would learn the principles and techniques of fine arts, such as drawing from models and studying classical artworks. This movement was largely influenced by Renaissance art and the classical tradition, but also incorporated techniques from contemporary movements such as Neoclassicism.
<br><br>
Academic artists focused on creating realistic and technically proficient artwork, often depicting historical, mythological or religious scenes. These works were highly polished and precise, with clean lines and realistic representations of the human figure. Notable Academic artists include Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres and William-Adolphe Bouguereau.
<br><br>
The Academic art movement was highly influential in Europe and the United States, with many major art institutions teaching this method until the late 19th century when impressionism and other modern movements began to gain popularity. Despite its decline in mainstream art, the principles of academic art are still taught in many art schools and its influence can be seen in representational figurative art today.

				Realism

				Time period: Post-Renaissance

				<br><br>
				Notable artists: Gustave Courbet, Jean-Francois Millet
			</h6>

			<p>
Realism was an art movement from the mid-19th century; artists sought to depict everyday life and contemporary society realistically, without idealization or romanticization. Realist artists focused on objective reality and the mundane, often drawing inspiration from the working class and rural subjects. Symbolism and supernatural themes were often omitted, in favor of depicting the “real” world as it was.
<br><br>
Famous Realist artists include Gustave Courbet and Jean-Francois Millet, who were known for their depictions of peasant life and natural landscapes. The Realist movement had a significant impact on future art movements such as Hyperrealism and Photorealism. 
<br><br>
Realism veered away from the stylized and exaggerated depictions of life in previous art movements, in favor of embracing the everyday world. The naturalism movement was closely related to the realism movement; artists aimed to represent nature as they saw it, without stylization.

			<h1>
				Impressionism
			</h1>
			<h6>
				Time period: Modern
				<br>
				Centuries:19th century
				<br><br>
				Notable artists: Monet, Edgar Degas, Renoir
			</h6>

			<p>
The Impressionist movement was a popular art movement in France in the mid-19th century. The goal of the Impressionism art style is to capture nature, with a focus on the appearance of light and color, as opposed to a focus on realism or rendering details.
<br><br>
Impressionism is one of the most well-known art movements and it emerged in France in the late 19th century. Artists like Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir focused on capturing the fleeting impressions and effects of light in their paintings.
<br><br>
Painters would apply paint in thick, loose brushstrokes, using a technique called impasto painting to create texture on the canvas surface.
<br><br>
Monet would apply unmixed paint colors to the canvas to create a sense of diversity and movement on the surface. This leads to the viewer mixing colors optically rather than physically, as the eye blends them.
<br><br>
Impressionist artists in France rejected the notion of exhibitions and academies controlled by the state, in favor of independent exhibitions. From this, more individual and painterly art styles flourished that exemplified the joy of using color and of painting itself. This contrasted to the more restrictive and realistic representations of subject matter that the academies taught.
