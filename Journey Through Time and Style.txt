Ancient Egyptian Art
Time period: Ancient
Centuries: 3150 BC to 640 AD

Characteristics: Depiction of royalty and gods, symmetrical composition, use of hieroglyphics

Influences: Religion, politics

Ancient Egyptian art is known for its precise and detailed depictions of their rulers and gods. They were also skilled in sculpture, architecture and the use of hieroglyphics. There were no unique artistic styles recognised to be attributed to individual artists. Rather, the Ancient Egyptians created artworks based on the conventions that were held at the time. They aimed to represent the relationships between humans, kings and the gods.

The arrival of the Greeks and Romans in Egypt led to a fusion of styles and techniques. The ancient Egyptians made carvings, sculptures and used pigments to paint on tombstone walls.

The Ancient Egyptian period spanned thousands of years and can be divided into eight periods and dynasties, with different pharaohs and political leaders.

Ancient Greek Art
Time period: Ancient
Centuries: 900 to 330 BC

Characteristics: Idealisation of human form, focus on philosophy and mythology

Influences: Philosophy, athletics, politics

Ancient Greek art focused heavily on the human form, often depicting athleticism in a realistic but idealised manner. The Greeks were also known for their intricate sculptures and pottery designs. The Ancient Greeks developed the contrapposto technique in sculpture, which was a natural pose, whereby the figure rests their weight on one knee. This post created a sense of balance and realism in their sculptures. The contrapposto technique was later picked up by artists from the Renaissance and Neoclassical periods.

Ancient Greek art can be further categorised into the Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic periods. The Archaic period saw the introduction of new techniques such as marble carving, while the Classical period is known for its portrayal of motion and emotion in sculpture and painting. The Hellenistic period saw an influence from Eastern cultures, leading to more elaborate designs and decorative elements. The Greeks used encaustic and tempera painting mediums and substrates such as wooden board to create portraits, figural scenes and still lives.

Western Medieval Art
Time period: Medieval
Centuries: 5th to 15th century

Characteristics: Religious themes, use of gold and bright colours, stylised figures

Influences: Christianity, Byzantine art

Western Medieval art saw a shift towards Christian themes and the rise of religious institutions such as the Catholic Church.

With paintings often depicting biblical scenes and figures. Gold was commonly used in illuminated manuscripts and paintings, giving a sense of richness and importance to the subject matter.

One of the most famous artworks from this period is the Bayeux Tapestry. Which is a 230 foot long embroidered cloth depicting the Norman conquest of England.

The medieval time period encompasses many sub classifications of art styles and movements, including Byzantine, Romanesque, Gothic and Coptic art.

****************************************

Renaissance
Time period: Renaissance
Centuries: 14th to the 17th centuries

Notable artists: Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo

The Renaissance art movement, characterised by realism and classical themes, emerged in Italy during the 14th century and spread throughout Europe. 

During this period, there came a renewed interest in classical studies of Greek and Roman literature and art. The Mannerism period which marked the end of the Renaissance was characterised by expressiveness, theatricality and artificiality, which began to diverge from the style of the High Renaissance.

Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello were some of the most influential figures in the Renaissance art movement. Their works often depicted classical themes, mythology and religious subjects. Their paintings demonstrated naturalistic techniques such as linear perspective to create a sense of depth in their paintings and sculptures.

Artists began to work with oil paints in this period and from working with this new medium came new paint application techniques that are still taught today. Artists would paint in layers, using techniques such as glazing. Techniques such as sfumato, where oil paints are blended to create a smoky appearance were invented by da Vinci. Sfumato was a technique used in the painting the Mona Lisa, around her mouth to create the illusion of a smile. The famous Mona Lisa, which came out of the High Renaissance period is regarded as the most famous painting in the world.

****************************************

Baroque
Time period: Post-Renaissance
Centuries: 17th century

Notable artists: Rembrandt, Caravaggio, Vermeer

The Baroque style followed, featuring exaggerated motion and clear detail to produce drama, emotion, and tension. Baroque paintings were often theatrical and used symbolism to convey narratives.

The Dutch Golden Age, a time of great prosperity in the Netherlands, saw artists like Rembrandt become famous for their portraits and genre scenes. Baroque art also spread to Catholic countries such as Italy. Caravaggio used the chiaroscuro or ‘tenebrism‘ techniques. This is the use of dramatic lighting and contrasted values to create emotion and tension in a scene. Portrait artists still use this technique today.

****************************************

Rococo
Time period: Post-Renaissance
Centuries: 18th century

Notable artists: Jean-Antoine Watteau, François Boucher

Rococo art emerged in France as a more lighthearted and playful art style, which contrasted to the serious and classical styles of the Baroque period. Pastel colours, ornate details, and scenes of leisure and pleasure characterise the Rococo art style. Artists often portrayed romanticised scenes of aristocratic parties, music concerts, and outdoor excursions in their paintings and sculptures. Notable Rococo artists include Jean-Antoine Watteau and François Boucher.

****************************************

Neoclassicism
Time period: Post-Renaissance
Centuries: 18th to 19th centuries

Notable artists: Jacques Louis David, John Flaxman

Neoclassicism came about as a reaction against the vanity, frivolity and excess of the Rococo movement. Neoclassical artists looked to classical art and culture, particularly Ancient Roman and Greek, for inspiration and used it to convey moral messages and values.

The 18th and 19th centuries were labelled the periods of enlightenment due to the abundance of scientific discoveries across this time period. Artists wanted their artworks to live up to the standards of the Romans’ and Greeks’ art.

Neoclassical art often features heroic figures from history or mythology, depicted in a serious manner with strong lines and minimal colours.

The neoclassical style spread throughout Europe and beyond, influencing movements such as the American Federal style in architecture.

****************************************

Romanticism
Period: Post-Renaissance
Centuries: 18th and 19th centuries

Notable artists:  Eugene Delacroix, Caspar David Friedrich

Romanticism was an art style that emphasises emotion and individual expression. The art movement was spurred by a desire for liberty during times of political upheaval, such as the French Revolution. 

This art movement came about against the backdrop of the industrial revolution; artists were reacting to societal norms of the age of enlightenment, where the course of human history was changed by new scientific discoveries, rationalisation of nature and the modern sprawl of society.

Romantic artists depicted scenes of drama and passion, often including elements of nature or the supernatural. They also delved into personal emotions and expressions through self-portraits and depictions of the human psyche. Notable Romantic artists include Eugene Delacroix and Caspar David Friedrich who are known for their use of dramatic scenes, and emotive subject matter. Caspar David Friedrich painted ethereal looking scenes, of morning mist, ruins and mysterious figures in the landscape.

The Romantic movement was widespread throughout Europe and had a lasting impact on future art movements such as Symbolism and Expressionism. The themes in Romantic art are often the emphasis on sublimity in nature, individualism, emotion and the past.

The Romanticism art movement used medievalism as a source of inspiration, idealising fantasy, spontaneity and visceral reactions to the environment to revolt against the progressive rationalism at the time. The Romantic art style served almost as an escapism from the industrialised society.

****************************************

Academic Art
Time period: Post-renaissance
Century: 16th to the 19th century

Notable artists:  Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, William-Adolphe Bouguereau

Academic art is an art style and method of teaching art developed in the 19th century. The Academies were official institutions where artists would learn the principles and techniques of fine arts, such as drawing from models and studying classical artworks. This movement was largely influenced by Renaissance art and the classical tradition, but also incorporated techniques from contemporary movements such as Neoclassicism.

Academic artists focused on creating realistic and technically proficient artwork, often depicting historical, mythological or religious scenes. These works were highly polished and precise, with clean lines and realistic representations of the human figure. Notable Academic artists include Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres and William-Adolphe Bouguereau.

The Academic art movement was highly influential in Europe and the United States, with many major art institutions teaching this method until the late 19th century when impressionism and other modern movements began to gain popularity. Despite its decline in mainstream art, the principles of academic art are still taught in many art schools and its influence can be seen in representational figurative art today.

****************************************

Realism
Time period: Post-Renaissance
Century: 19th century

Notable artists: Gustave Courbet, Jean-Francois Millet

Realism was an art movement from the mid-19th century; artists sought to depict everyday life and contemporary society in a realistic manner, without idealisation or romanticisation. Realist artists focused on objective reality and the mundane, often drawing inspiration from the working class and rural subjects. Symbolism and supernatural themes were often omitted, in favour of depicting the “real” world as it was.

Famous Realist artists include Gustave Courbet and Jean-Francois Millet, who were known for their depictions of peasant life and natural landscapes. The Realist movement had a significant impact on future art movements such as Hyperrealism and Photorealism. 

Realism veered away from the stylised and exaggerated depictions of life in previous art movements, in favour of embracing the everyday world. The naturalism movement was closely related to the realism movement; artists aimed to represent nature as they saw it, without stylisation.

****************************************

Impressionism
Time period: Modern
Century: 19th century

Notable artists: Monet, Edgar Degas, Renoir

The Impressionist movement was a popular art movement in France in the mid-19th century. The goal of the Impressionism art style is to capture nature, with a focus on the appearance of light and colour, as opposed to a focus on realism or rendering details.

Impressionism is one of the most well known art movements and it emerged in France in the late 19th century. Artists like Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir focused on capturing the fleeting impressions and effects of light in their paintings.

Painters would apply paint in thick, loose brushstrokes, using a technique called impasto painting to create texture on the canvas surface.

Monet would apply unmixed paint colours to the canvas to create a sense of diversity and movement on the surface. This leads to the viewer mixing colours optically rather than physically, as the eye blends them together.

Impressionist artists in France rejected the notion of exhibitions and academies controlled by the state, in favour of independent exhibitions. From this, more individual and painterly art styles flourished that exemplified the joy of using colour and of painting itself. This contrasted to the more restrictive and realistic representations of subject matter that the academies taught.

****************************************

Post-Impressionism
Time period: Modern
Centuries: 19th century

Notable artists: Paul Cezanne, Edgar Degas, Van Gogh, Paul Gauguin

Post-Impressionism was closely related to the Impressionism art style and art movement, however, artists expanded upon its principles to create more expressive styles. Artists used individual creativity, techniques and style to represent their subject matter, as opposed to using techniques taught in academies to achieve realism. Post-Impressionist artists such as Paul Cezanne focused on creating a sense of structure and order in their work, while others like Vincent Van Gogh experimented with bold colours and expressive brushstrokes.

There are lots of overlaps between impressionism and post-impressionism, with the emphasis on the painterly nature of the artworks and the use of bright colours. However, Post-Impressionism focussed more on the structure and composition of the artwork alongside incorporating symbology, rather than using fleeting, transitory moments as references. Impressionism focussed on capturing moments with light and colour, whilst Post-Impressionists focussed on creating more expressive artworks.

Post-Impressionist artists also often drew inspiration from non-Western art, including African and Japanese art, as well as folk art. Post-Impressionism had a significant impact on later movements such as Fauvism, Cubism, and Expressionism.

****************************************

Expressionism
Time period: Modern
Centuries: 20th century

Notable artists: Vincent van Gogh, Edvard Munch, Wassily Kandinsky

Expressionism was a modern movement that emphasised the artist’s inner emotions or response to the subject matter, rather than an accurate depiction. It often featured distorted or abstracted forms, bright colours, and exaggerated gestures.

Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh is well-known for his expressive brushstrokes and intense use of colour in works such as “The Starry Night.” Norwegian painter Edvard Munch’s painting “The Scream” is a famous example of Expressionist art, depicting a figure with an exaggerated facial expression and distorted figure. Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky is known for his abstract works, which emphasised spiritual and emotional expression.

Expressionism evolved from Post-Impressionist movements that focused on psychological and expressive elements in art, as well as influences from Symbolism, Romanticism and Fauvism.

****************************************

Pointillism
Time period: Modern
Century: 19th century

Notable artists: Georges Seurat, Paul Signac

Pointillism, also known as Divisionism, was a technique developed in the late 19th century by artists like Georges Seurat and Paul Signac. These artists used small dots or “points” of unmixed colour to create the impression of a wider range of hues and tones.

Pointillist artists placed great emphasis on scientific theories about vision and the perception of colour contrast. They believed that using dots of unmixed pigments would allow for greater luminosity and vibrant colour in their artworks.

The Pointillist movement also had connections with Neo-Impressionism and the Japanese art of Ukiyo-e woodblock printing. Pointillist artists often painted landscapes and scenes from modern life, creating a sense of harmony and order in their compositions through the use of geometric elements like lines and shapes.

Notable works include Seurat’s “A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte” and Signac’s “Signal at Grandcamp.” The technique was briefly popular but had declined by the early 20th century, with movements like Cubism becoming more influential. However, its impact can still be seen in art movements such as Abstract Expressionism.

****************************************

Naïve Art
Time period: Modern
Centuries: 19th century

Notable artists: Paul Gauguin, Frida Kahlo, L.S. Lowry

Naïve art, sometimes referred to as Primitivism or outsider art, is an art style defined by simplicity. Some artists who painted in this art style had a lack of formal training in art techniques. This led to artists producing unique styles and interpretations of subject matter.

Well known artists from this movement include French painter Henri Rousseau and Mexican artist Frida Kahlo.

French artist Paul Gauguin is well-known for his travels to Tahiti, where he painted scenes inspired by the culture and indigenous people. Mexican artist Frida Kahlo also drew upon the Pre-Columbian cultures of her home country in her work, often including elements of folk crafts and traditional dress in self portraits. Frida Kahlo is also recognised as being a part of many other art styles and art movements that were happening at the time, such as Symbolism, Naturalism, Social Realism and Magical Realism.

Naïve art was closely related to the trend of “primitivism” in modernist literature, as well as movements such as Symbolism and Surrealism, which shared an interest in dreamlike or non-Western imagery.

However, this movement has also been criticised for its appropriation and misrepresentation of non-Western cultures by Western artists.

****************************************

Tonalism
Time period: Modern
Centuries: 19th century

Notable artists: George Inness, James McNeill Whistler

American painter George Inness is considered the leading figure of Tonalism, often depicting scenes of nature with a hazy, dreamlike quality. American-born British painter James McNeill Whistler was also known for his tonalist works, such as his famous painting “Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket.”

Tonalism was related to the American “Hudson River School” movement, which focused on realistic depictions of nature, but Tonalist works were often more abstract and atmospheric. It also had connections to European movements such as Impressionism and Symbolism, with their emphasis on mood and atmosphere in art.

The movement was pioneered by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso and French artist Georges Braque, who were later joined by artists such as Juan Gris in exploring Cubism’s distinct visual language.

Cubist works often depicted multiple viewpoints or facets of a subject at once, deconstructing traditional forms into geometric shapes. The movement also drew upon influences from African and Iberian sculpture, as well as the later developments of Analytical Cubism and Synthetic Cubism.

****************************************

Futurism
Time period: Modern
Centuries: 20th century

Notable artists: Umberto Boccioni, Fortunato Depero, Luigi Russolo

Emphasising the speed, technology, and violence of modern times, Futurism was a short-lived but influential modern art movement that surfaced in Italy in the early 20th century,

Italian artist Umberto Boccioni was a leading figure in the movement, developing the concept of “dynamic form” to depict motion and change in his paintings and sculptures. Italian artist Fortunato Depero made a name for himself with his Futurist book covers and advertising designs. Composer Luigi Russolo also played a significant role in the movement, creating experimental musical instruments to evoke the sounds of modern life in his compositions.

Futurism had a major impact on other modern art movements, including Vorticism and Constructivism, as well as influencing Futurist architecture and literature.
